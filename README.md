# CS470 Senior Project
CS470_Final_Report.pdf is the PDF file of my final report. 

CS470(1).ipynb file contains all the code that was used to create CRNN models for my project. The program should run by running each cell from the first to last cell in that exact order. 

The mongol_bichig folder contains all the images in the images folder along with the excel files that are used in the code to read in the images and their labels.
